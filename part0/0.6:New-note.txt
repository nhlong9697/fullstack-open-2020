note over browser:
new note as JSON-data containing both the content of the new note and timestamp
is sent from browser to server through the following HTTP method
(Content-Type header of the request tells the server that 
the included data is represented in the JSON format)
end note
browser->server: HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa
server-->browser: HTTP with status code 201 - created
note over server:
This time the server does not ask for a redirect, 
the browser stays on the same page, and it sends no further HTTP requests

The SPA version of the app does not send the form data in the traditional way, 
but instead uses the JavaScript code it fetched from the server
end note
